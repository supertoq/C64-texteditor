You can open and edit text files that you’ve transferred to the C64 from Windows or Linux. After editing them on the C64, you can process the text file on your PC again—it remains compatible.  
The editor supports the 7-bit ASCII character set (ANSI X3.4-1986), with the exception of the NUL and CR characters, which are deliberately ignored when loading a file.  
Special characters are mapped to suitable C64 screen codes for display.  
  
### Features
  
- Files are saved as C64 SEQ files containing plain ASCII text.  
  (On Windows, the file extension must be changed to `.txt`.)
- Optional line endings: LF or CRLF.
- Text buffer at `$36B7-$CEFF` (38,985 bytes); BASIC ROM is switched off.
- The uppercase/lowercase character set is copied to RAM at `$3000`.
- Application memory usage: approx. 15 KB.
- All keyboard input is converted to ASCII.  
- Characters that cannot be entered directly via the keyboard can be entered manually using F8.  
- Custom characters for German UTF-8 umlauts.  
- Drives 8–11 can be selected for loading and saving; disks are checked for space before saving. 
- File access via the UCI interface (Ultimate 64, C64 Ultimate) presented as drive U.
- UCI: Files that are too large to fit in memory are split into parts; so you can still read them (e.g. book).

### Keyboard Controls  
    F1 = Save   F3 = Load   F5 = New   F8 = Code input   F7 = Quit  
      
    Cursor keys  =  Move cursor 
    HOME    =   Start of line
    HOME 2x =   Start of text/file
    CLR     =   End of text/file 
    F2      =   Display control characters on/off 
    F4 / F6 =   Page up / down   
  
    DEL          =  Backspace          
    SHIFT+DEL    =  Delete (INST)     
    RETURN       =  New line           
    CTRL+I       =  Tabulator  
  
    Direct character input on the C64 keyboard:  
        Pound              = Backslash \  
        SHIFT+Pound        = Underscope _ 
        Left Arrow         = Backtick `
        SHIFT+Plus         = Curly Brace {
        SHIFT+Minus        = Curly Brace }
        | (Up Arrow)       = ASCII character Pipe (|)         
        SHIFT+| (Up Arrow) = Caret ^  
        SHIFT+:            = Square Bracket [  
        SHIFT+;            = Square Bracket ]  
  
    F8 = Enter any ASCII code (decimal) 
         33–126 = printable ASCII characters   
         0–31 = control characters, 32 = SPACE, 127 = DEL
         (Inputs of 0 and 13 are ignored)  
  
         Examples of decimal values:  
         126 = ~  125 = }  123 = {  96 = `  9 = Tab   
  
         Umlauts as Unicode input:  
         228 = ä  246 = ö  252 = ü  
         196 = Ä  214 = Ö  220 = Ü  223 = ß  
         
  
### Starting
Start the program from floppy disk using `LOAD"TEXTEDITOR",8,1` and `RUN`.
  
### File Browser, Drive Selection, Loading and Saving

When loading (F3) or saving (F1), a file browser is displayed. You can select floppy drives 8–11. On Ultimate devices, drive U is also available, providing direct access to USB sticks and SD cards through UCI file access.

Use the CRSR Up/Down keys to navigate. Press RETURN to open a directory, or select '..' to go back. In LOAD mode, press RETURN on a filename to load it. In SAVE mode, press RETURN to copy the filename to the input line. You can then edit the filename and press RETURN again to save. A confirmation prompt helps prevent accidental overwrites.
The wildcards '*' and '?' can be used when selecting files, but not when saving. You can optionally enter '$' to re-read the drive contents. Filenames can be up to 25 characters long for UCI and 16 characters for floppy disks. UCI access is case-sensitive.  
  
### Exiting
To exit the editor, press F8 then confirm by pressing Y.  
  
### Quick Note
The line ending (LF/CRLF), the file extensions in the blocklist, translated characters, colours, and text outputs, can all be easily changed in the source code. You’ll find them as options near the top, below the descriptions.
